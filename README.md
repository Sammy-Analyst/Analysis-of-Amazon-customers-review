## DATA SOURCE

The Primary Data used here is DSA Data Analysis capstone project.xlsx for Amazon case study

DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATIONS
At the preliminary phase of the data cleaning and preparations , I performed the following actions;

### i. Data loading and inspection

Data loading and inspection are crucial steps in data analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability. In Excel, data is loaded through importing Excel file. Once loaded, data inspection involves checking for missing values, outliers, and data types using Excel's Data Validation. Power Query in Excel improves data inspection through interactive visualizations, allowing users to quickly identify trends and discrepancies.

### ii. Data cleaning and formatting

Excel was used in cleaning data which involves removing duplicates (using "Remove Duplicates" tool), and formatting data (using Text to Columns, Trim, and PROPER functions). Power Query in Excel was also used to "Transform" and remove blanks, trim text, and change data types. Excel's "Data Validation" tools help identify inconsistencies and errors.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

## DATA ANALYSIS

INSIGHTS

i. Certain categories consistently offer higher discounts, but this does not always correlate with higher ratings.

ii. Products in mid-price ranges (‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500) are most common.

iii. Top-rated products are not always the most reviewed, indicating potential for under-discovered quality products.
